<p>
  When I was young, my Grandmother would remind me at least once a week how lucky we are but also how quickly the cruel hand of fate can just as quickly take away everything we have.
  </p>

<p>As such, I was brought up with a sense of social justice and an urgency to treat others as I would wish to be treated.

</p>

<p>I feel that my strengths are my empathy towards others and an ability to see the best qualities in those around me.

</p>

<p>My weakness is what I call my "Existential Malaise" That is, I get into a mood where I think to deeply about things and as a consequence I can become incredibably self critical.
