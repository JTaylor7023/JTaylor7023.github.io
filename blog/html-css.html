        <article>
          <p>Id's and Classes are labels or hooks that we attach to elements to style or target them</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Id: It's like a name tag and is unique.
            </li>
            <li>Classes: Is like a group badge and can be shared.</li>
            
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>
          <h2>
            Right, lets get a bit more specific:
          </h2>
          <section class="main-section" id="Id">
        <header>Id's</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Id's are unique. That means you can only use them on ONE elemnt. This may not appear important but if you use an Id on more than one element your code will not pass.
          </p>
          <li>
            <ul>
              Each element can only have one Id.
            </ul>
            <ul>
              Each page can have only one element with that ID
            </ul>
          </li>

          
        
        </article>
      </section>
           <section class="main-section" id="classes">
        <header>Classes</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Classes are not unique. 
          </p>
          <li>
            <ul>
              You can use the same class on multiple elements.
            </ul>
            <ul>
              You can use multiple classes on the same element.
            </ul>
          </li>
        </article>
             <section class="main-section" id="things-to-know">
        <header>Things to know</header>
        <article>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS doesn't care.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In CSS there is nothing you can't do with a class and vice versa
          </p>
          <ul>
            Javacript cares.
          </ul>
          <p>
           Javascript depends on there being one element with a particular Id
          </p>
          <ul>
            If you don't need them don't use them.
          </ul>
          <p>
            Classes and IDâ€™s are very important and we rely on them every day to do the styling and page manipulation that we need to do. However, you should use them judiciously and semantically.
