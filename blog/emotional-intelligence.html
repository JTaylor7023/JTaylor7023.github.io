            In today's hyper-connected, constantly evolving world, emotional
            intelligence (EI) isn't just a "nice to have" trait, it's a core
            skill. Whether you're steering a team, nurturing a relationship, or
            pursuing personal growth, the ability to recognise, understand and
            manage emotions is pivotal for success and wellbeing.

          <h2 class="title is-4">What Is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is the capacity to perceive, interpret,
            regulate, and influence emotions, both our own and those of others.
            Daniel Goleman, a leading voice on the subject, identifies five
            foundational pillars:
          </p>

          <div class="columns is-multiline">
            <div class="column is-half">
              <strong>Self-awareness:</strong> Knowing what you feel and how
              those feelings shape your thoughts and actions.
            </div>
            <div class="column is-half">
              <strong>Self-regulation:</strong> Steering emotions
              constructively, especially under pressure.
            </div>
            <div class="column is-half">
              <strong>Motivation:</strong> Channeling emotions to pursue goals
              with vigor and perseverance.
            </div>
            <div class="column is-half">
              <strong>Empathy:</strong> Sensing others' emotions and responding
              with genuine care.
            </div>
            <div class="column is-half">
              <strong>Social skills:</strong> Building and maintaining healthy
              relationships through effective communication and conflict
              resolution.

          </div>

        <div class="notification is-info">
          <h2 class="title is-4">Why Does It Matter?</h2>
          <p>
            High EI leads to stronger connections, better mental health,
            superior job performance, and sstronger leadership. Research shows
            that emotional intelligence can out predict raw IQ when it comes to
            real world achievement.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            "It is very important to understand that emotional intelligence is
            not the opposite of intelligence, it is not the triumph of heart
            over head - it is the unique intersection of both." - David Caruso
          </blockquote>

        <div class="box">
          <h2 class="title is-4">Can You Boost Your Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
          <p>
            Absolutely! like any skill, EI grows with deliberate practice. Try
            these starter steps:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reflect daily on your emotional reactions and pinpoint triggers.
            </li>
            <li>Incorporate mindfulness or meditation to stay present.</li>
            <li>
              Ask trusted friends for candid feedback on how you handle
              emotions.
            </li>
            <li>Study role models who demonstrate strong emotional insight.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
          <h2 class="title is-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence isn't about bottling up feelings; it's about
            understanding them deeply and using that awareness to make your own
            life and the lives of those around you. In this modern world
            brimming with complexity and human interaction, investing in EI can
            pay lifelong dividends.
