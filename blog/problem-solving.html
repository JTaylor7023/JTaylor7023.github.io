        <h2>1. Blocked on a Simple Problem</h2>
        <p>
          My <strong>main.css</strong> stylesheet was a mess of duplicate
          classes and styles that I had used over different pages. I also
          noticed that I had a bunch of error messages in my code. The first
          thing I did was to go through the code and isolate the error messages.
          For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed a typo in my <code>blockquote</code> (<code
              >var(var(--primary-color))</code
            >
            → <code>var(--primary-color)</code>)
          </li>
          <li>Fixed a missing semicolon in <code>.story</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It was a great feeling once I had saved my work to see
          <em>main</em> turn from red!
        </p>
        <p>
          The lesson I took from this was to pause and check things carefully
          (particularly with CSS). With JavaScript, if something's not working I
          think I will realise that there is an error and I cna troubleshoot,
          but CSS is more subtle. I also learned that when I build multi-page
          websites, I should treat them as parts of a whole rather than separate
          entities.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Elegantly Solved a Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Once the obvious errors were fixed, I turned to improving the
          structure of my stylesheet. These are the changes that I made:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Grouped repeated backgrounds, border-radius, box-shadows,
            transitions into shared blocks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combined <code>.navbar</code> and <code>nav</code> where they shared
            base styles.
          </li>
          <li>Removed duplicate hover/transition definitions.</li>
          <li>
            Fixed <code>blockquote</code> typo and <code>.story</code> missing
            semicolon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplified repeated <code>pre</code>, <code>code</code>, and
            <code>ul/li</code> spacing rules.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This felt much more elegant, and I was really satisfied with the
          cleaner result.
        </p>

          3. Reflection on Problem-Solving Techniques
        </h2>
        <p>I feel confident using:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pseudocode:</strong>helpful for structuring before coding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Googling:</strong>great for looking up syntax or approaches.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reading error messages:</strong>particularly after this
            exercise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Console.logging:</strong>a tool I’m very comfortable with.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>I haven't yet had to, but I feel okay about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Asking for help:</strong>from peers or coaches when needed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>And finally, I've learned the value of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Reflection</strong>it helped me identify mistakes, spot
            repetition, and improve my process overall. And boy, did I do a lot
            of reflection!
