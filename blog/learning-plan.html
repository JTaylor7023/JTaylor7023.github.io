        The reason I joined Dev Academy was that I was looking for a new
        challenge and a change of career.Idealy I would like to get a job in the
        tech industry after I have completed this.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strengths as a learner are that I have always valued education so
        that makes me dedicated towards the learning process. I have processes
        that I follow that I find work and that aid my learning. My weaknesses
        are that I am prone to trying to do things to quickly and also I can
        spend to much time trying to solve a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am commited to putting in the necessary hours to finish my work on
        time, however I am mindful to look after my mental and physical well
        being and ensure I don't burn out.I will treat my fellow students and
        facilitators with respect and kindness and hope that I am treated in a
        same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I said earlier, I am inclined to spend to much time trying to solve a
        problem. It isn't that I see asking for help as a weakness, it is just
        something inherent in my nature. So, I will only spend a couple of hours
        at the most trying to solve something before I reach out for help
        (unless I sleep on it and it comes to me in the night).
      </p>
      <p>
        So far the facilitators have been excellent. Friendly, patient and kind
        and willing to help. It's what I expect and I don't see it changing.
      </p>
      <p>
        To expand on that, when I had my first attempt at Dev Academy and things
        got out of my control, David was incredibly patient and understanding to
        what I was going through. I think the holistic, people first approach of
        Dev Academy is to be commended and is quite possibly it's greatest
        strength as an educational provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be the odd scheduling issue but I will notify the facilitators
        if that will be the case. However, I don't really foresee anything.
        (fingers crossed).
