          <p>
            Looking back over the five weeks of foundations, it has been quite
            the ride. I feel challenged, competent and perhaps a bit
            apprehensive about what is to come. I know that bootcamp will be a
            whole other level and it may take time to develop the new rhythm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where do I see myself career wise? I don’t know. I’m not doing this
            for money or for fame or status. I would like to use my skills for
            something worthwhile. Something ethical that is about people and
            community and not about making another million for some faceless
            corporate.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think my strengths going into bootcamp will be my ability to
            communicate and to listen effectively. I feel that as a group we
            have a pretty good understanding of one another. The Thursday catch
            ups were an inspired idea that has fostered the sense of
            togetherness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weakness…probably getting into a new and different rhythm. For me
            the afternoons may be the most difficult. Some people are morning
            people, some night…me I’m both but I’m never at my best in the
            afternoon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Non technical skills—probably working in a group. I’m the
            personality who generally prefers my own company. I’m very excited
            about pairing though.
          </p>
          <p>
            Expectations from you lot. I guess it will just be getting feedback,
            particularly if something is a challenge. I don’t see it being an
            issue. I like the Dev Academy’s holistic approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            And finally, what do I expect from myself. Don’t stress, don’t
            listen to the inner voice that says you shouldn’t be here. Do
            communicate if I’m struggling and if I can help others to solve
            problems and encourage my fellow travellers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The reason I joined Dev Academy was that I was looking for a new
            challenge and a change of career. Ideally I would like to get a job
            in the tech industry after I have completed this. To expand on this,
            it isn’t about money or prestige or whatever that motivates me to
            work in the tech industry, it's about learning the tools to make
            something worthwhile that will benefit the community. Off the top of
            my head as an example, something that could make people who have
            disabilities lives better. Grandiose, maybe!
          </p>
          <p>
            My strengths as a learner are that I have always valued education so
            that makes me dedicated towards the learning process. I have
            processes that I follow that I find work and that aid my learning.
            My weaknesses are that I am prone to trying to do things too quickly
            and also I can spend too much time trying to solve a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am committed to putting in the necessary hours to finish my work
            on time, however I am mindful to look after my mental and physical
            well being and ensure I don't burn out. I will treat my fellow
            students and facilitators with respect and kindness and hope that I
            am treated in a same way.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I said earlier, I am inclined to spend too much time trying to
            solve a problem. It isn't that I see asking for help as a weakness,
            it is just something inherent in my nature. So, I will only spend a
            couple of hours at the most trying to solve something before I reach
            out for help (unless I sleep on it and it comes to me in the night).
          </p>
          <p>
            So far the facilitators have been excellent. Friendly, patient and
            kind and willing to help. It's what I expect and I don't see it
            changing.
          </p>
          <p>
            To expand on that, when I had my first attempt at Dev Academy and
            things got out of my control, David was incredibly patient and
            understanding to what I was going through. I think the holistic,
            people-first approach of Dev Academy is to be commended and is quite
            possibly its greatest strength as an educational provider.
          </p>
          <p>
            There may be the odd scheduling issue but I will notify the
            facilitators if that will be the case. However, I don't really
            foresee anything. (fingers crossed).
