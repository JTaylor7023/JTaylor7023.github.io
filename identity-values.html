        When I was young, my Grandmother would remind me at least once a week how lucky we are but also how quickly the cruel hand of fate can just as quickly take away everything we have.

      <p>
        As such, I was brought up with a sense of social justice and an urgency to treat others as I wwould wish to be treated.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel that my strengths are my empathy towards others and an ability to see the best qualities in those around me.

        <p>
          That is, I get into a mood where I think to deeply about things and as a consequence I can become incredibably self critical.
